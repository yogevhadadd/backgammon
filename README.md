# Backgammon
A part of my full-stack development course, our final project was to develop a game. I've decided to write a backgammon game.  I've decided to create this game because I wanted a balance on developing:  
* The game - legal & illegal moves. This game has a variaty of rules, but not to many to make this the main of the development.
* Front-end - Login page, chat page & game page. Gives me experience on css and angular.
* Back-end - Micro-services, SQL using C# .Net
